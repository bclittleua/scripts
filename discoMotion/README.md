These files are deprecated as the discord lib was updated, but i leave them here to remember how they worked.

Essentially, Motion (https://motion-project.github.io/) ran on a raspberry pi with and camera and would send webhooks to a discord channel based on the event, i.e. sensing motion.
The files aboves 'listened' for Motion's webhooks and responded accordingly. 
In short, this 'bot' talks to itself (but really, Motion is talking to python via discord)
